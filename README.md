# Run, Robot, Run!
University of Manitoba - Fall 2016<br>
COMP 3490 - Computer Graphics I<br>
Assignment 4

<br>

## Requirements:
* Java JDK 7 or 8
* OpenGL 2.1
* JOGL 2.3

A program that uses a robot, created in a previous assignment, to move through a fully texture-mapped and animated 3D world. If the robot hits a wall or a post or a box, it dies, and immediately respawns in the center of the world.

## Controls:
* `a` and `d` to turn left and right, respectively
* `w` and `s` to move faster and slower, respectively
* `f` to toggle between smooth shading with lighting effects and flat shading with no lighting effects
* `space` to jump (the robot is unable to move, speed up, or slow down while jumping)
* `enter` to toggle freelook mode
  * While in freelook mode, click and drag the mouse to change the camera angle

Written in Java, this program can be compiled and run in [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) with the above listed requirements as part of the build settings/library. All required and numerous optional aspects of the assignment were implemented to achieve a 100% grade.
